# Customer Segmentation Analysis for Enhanced Targeting

## Project Synopsis

This project involves the analysis of transaction data from a UK-based non-store online retail recorded between December 2010 and December 2011. By employing machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, we have identified distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.

### Objective

The primary objective was to segment the retail customers based on three key metrics:
- **Frequency of Purchases**
- **Total Spending**
- **Average Purchase Value**

These metrics helped us to understand the diversity in customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Included cleaning and normalizing the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created features to summarize customer behavior.
3. **Clustering**: Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into eight distinct groups.

### Results

The clustering resulted in eight unique customer segments, each exhibiting different purchasing patterns and spending behaviors. These segments range from frequent, high-value purchasers to infrequent, low-spending customers.

### Conclusion

The insights from the segmentation enable targeted marketing strategies that cater to the specific needs and behaviors of different customer groups, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and business revenue.
